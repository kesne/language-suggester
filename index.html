        <h1>Language Suggester</h1>
        <p>Interested in learning how to code? With so many languages to choose from, even getting started can be a daunting task! The pressure to choose the "<em>right</em>" language to learn first with can lead many people to quit before they even start. But don't let that be you! I, my dear user, am here to help you decide once and for all!</p>
        <p>I've designed a simple yet highly informative survey that will guide you in the right direction<sup>*</sup> for choosing your first language to learn. If you just fill out the questions below, an incredibly advanced algorithm<sup>**</sup> will determine a few options that should be perfect just for you! The survey can guide you to all sorts of answers, from JavaScript, to Ruby, to Python, to C++ ⁠— the possibilities are endless! And always remember this: if you're not satisfied with the answer you receive, you can always take the survey again, or learn more languages after your first! Give it a go now and see what you get!</p>

        <p class="disclaimer">*the "right" direction is based on my admittedly minimal research ⁠— use survey at your own risk</p>
        <p class="disclaimer">**algorithm not actually incredibly advanced ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
